About CyanogenMOD 7.2

CyanogenMod is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 2.3.7 (GB),
which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.
CyanogenMod is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community.
It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed.

CyanogenMod does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway.

All the source code for CyanogenMod is available in the broadcomCM Github repo.

#About Nougat ME

This is a ROM which came originally from Lollipop ME ROM source which was released years ago for LG P350, by shelowe@XDA , 
then developed and themed by Zane Kilgore@XDA and me(raisul2010.5396@XDA) to make it themed like Android 7.0 Nougat. 
We strongly recommend to put our names on credits if you use our works, if you are thinking to use ROM source files
